    To be done :-

    Clear the previous images when a new search is initiated. // array ya object ko empty karna hai
    Include a loading indicator while images are being fetched. // ek loading ka animation daalna hai jab asyanchronous function operate kar reh.
    Include a "Show More" button that, when clicked, fetches and displays an additional 10 images related to the current search.// Show more ka button and uske baad 10 or more images.

    //Can be done:-

    Ensure that the button is intuitive and responsive to user interactions. // try karna ki phone and tablet pe responsive ho.
    Add a feature that allows users to save or favorite images. // har image ke nicehe name ke left ya right side meh ek star to mark it as favourite... but then will need to make a favourites page or something.. check it.
    Consider incorporating a lightbox or modal view for larger image previews. // explore what this is.
